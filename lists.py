# Python lists is a collection of arbitrary objects, somewhat akin to an array in many other languages but more flexible. Lists are defined in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of objects in square brackets [], as shown below: 
# a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux']
# print(a)

# Lists can be accessed by index 
a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux']
print(a[3])
print(a[1])

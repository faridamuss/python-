# n = 1000
# print(n)

# Python also allows chained assignment, which makes it possible to assign the same value to several variables simultaneously:
a = b = c = 200
print(a, b, c)

#The chained assignment above assigns 300 to the variables a, b, and c simultaneously.

# Variables in Python are not subject to this restriction. In Python, a variable may be assigned a value of one type and then later re-assigned a value of a different type:
var = 23.5
print (var)

var = "Now I'm a string"
print (var)

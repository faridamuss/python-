# x = 3
# x = x + 1
# print(x)

# To increment means to increase and to decrement means to decrease. Most coders don't write x = x+ 1 as they prefer the shorter notation, x += 1, which means the same thing.

# Let's consider the following task: ask a user to input any integer and decrease its value by 5. Try this out in your VSCode:
# anyNum = int(input())
# anyNum -= 5
# print(anyNum)

tripleUp = 5
tripleUp *= 3
print(tripleUp) # 15

quarterValue = 100
quarterValue /= 4
print(quarterValue) # 25.0

# A dictionary consists of a collection of key/value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. You can define a dictionary by ecolosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces {}. A colon (:) separated list of key-value pairs:

MLB_team = {
   "Colorado": "Rockies",
   "Boston": "Red Sox", 
   "Minnesota": "Twins",
}

print(MLB_team['Minnesota']) # you can access a value in the dictionary by its key name
